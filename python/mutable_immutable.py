# The code demonstrates how variable assignment works in Python, particularly with immutable types like integers and strings.
# When we assign x to y, both variables point to the same integer object initially.
# Changing x to a new integer does not affect y, which still points to the original value.
# When we assign a string to y, it now points to a new string object, leaving x unchanged.
# This illustrates the concept of immutability in Python, where integers and strings cannot be changed in place.# Mutable vs Immutable Types in Python
# This code snippet illustrates how variable assignment works with immutable types like integers and strings.
